Short list

0. Use export or related function to remove undesirable parts of NOMLEX-PLUS
   and COMNOM
1. Do new printout based on GLARF 97.5
2. Proofread specs for format and spelling (and missing stuff? ***)
   -- make sure that pdf looks reasonable -- fix spacing where needed
2. Finish other-dictionary section
   -- for each dictionary, catalog features and their interpretation
   -- or determine that this is already covered in specs and
      this additional manual is unnecessary
4. Update and fix up readmes
5. email Chris or someone else at LDC
   -- ask about: 1. COMNOM
		 2. WSJ files
		 3. distributing printed version of NomBank
6. update/fix website and download stuff

	   iii. compare to original NOMLEX-2007d ** done **
	   iv. add :SEMI-AUTOMATIC where appropriate ** done **
4. update website
5. COMNOM update
   i. create a version of current COMNOM
      in which only nouns are reset to
      COMNOM-2005b-utf8 -- see handy.lisp -- noun-only-overwrite -- debug
      -- differences
	 a. crusher + fives (latter is duplicate entry)
	 b. COUNTABLE, FEATURES, :PLURAL *** fixed **
	   -- differences in plurals -- need to check/verify, potentially update
	    with comlex morph?
	    -- should I do a general FEATURES check more automatically?
	 c. noun subcat (sentential and PP) -- handle in merge-comlex-nomlex???
	 d. entry for midnight -- (see below)*** fixed **
	 e. check if extra plurals are missing in NOMBANK

COMNOM-2007 vs. CONMOM-2006 -- minor changes that are OK
	    -- mostly adverb fixes
	    -- plus one update of the entry for "midnight"

COMNOM-2006 vs. COMNOM-2005c-all -- noun subc mostly

COMNOM-2005c-all vs. COMNOM-2005b -- same
